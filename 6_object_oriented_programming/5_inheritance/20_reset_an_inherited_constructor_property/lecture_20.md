ðŸš€ Reset an Inherited Constructor Property
------------------------------------------

When an object inherits its `prototype` from another object, it also inherits the supertype's constructor property.

Here's an example:

function Bird() { }
Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
let duck = new Bird();
duck.constructor // function Animal(){...}

But `duck` and all instances of `Bird` should show that they were constructed by `Bird` and not `Animal`. To do so, you can manually set `Bird's` constructor property to the `Bird` object:

Bird.prototype.constructor = Bird;
duck.constructor // function Bird(){...}

* * *

Fix the code so `duck.constructor` and `beagle.constructor` return their respective constructors.

* * *

*   ðŸ§ª `Bird.prototype` should be an instance of `Animal`.
*   ðŸ§ª `duck.constructor` should return `Bird`.
*   ðŸ§ª `Dog.prototype` should be an instance of `Animal`.
*   ðŸ§ª `beagle.constructor` should return `Dog`.
