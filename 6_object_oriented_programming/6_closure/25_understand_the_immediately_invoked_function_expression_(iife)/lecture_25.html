<p>A common pattern in JavaScript is to execute a function as soon as it is declared:</p><p></p><pre class=" language-js">(function () {
  console.log(&quot;Chirp, chirp!&quot;);
})(); // this is an anonymous function expression that executes right away
// Outputs &quot;Chirp, chirp!&quot; immediately
</pre><p></p>
<p>Note that the function has no name and is not stored in a variable. The two parentheses () at the end of the function expression cause it to be immediately executed or invoked. This pattern is known as an <dfn>immediately invoked function expression</dfn> or <dfn>IIFE</dfn>.</p>
