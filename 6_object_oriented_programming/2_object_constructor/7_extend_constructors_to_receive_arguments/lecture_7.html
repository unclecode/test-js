<p>The <code>Bird</code> and <code>Dog</code> constructors from last challenge worked well. However, notice that all <code>Birds</code> that are created with the <code>Bird</code> constructor are automatically named Albert, are blue in color, and have two legs. What if you want birds with different values for name and color? It&apos;s possible to change the properties of each bird manually but that would be a lot of work:</p><p></p><pre class="  language-js">let swan = new Bird();
swan.name = &quot;Carlos&quot;;
swan.color = &quot;white&quot;;
</pre><p></p>
<p>Suppose you were writing a program to keep track of hundreds or even thousands of different birds in an aviary. It would take a lot of time to create all the birds, then change the properties to different values for every one.
To more easily create different <code>Bird</code> objects, you can design your Bird constructor to accept parameters:</p>
<p></p><pre class="  language-js">function Bird(name, color) {
  this.name = name;
  this.color = color;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}
</pre><p></p>
<p>Then pass in the values as arguments to define each unique bird into the <code>Bird</code> constructor:
<code>let cardinal = new Bird(&quot;Bruce&quot;, &quot;red&quot;);</code>
This gives a new instance of <code>Bird</code> with name and color properties set to Bruce and red, respectively. The <code>numLegs</code> property is still set to 2.
The <code>cardinal</code> has these properties:</p>
<p></p><pre class="  language-js">cardinal.name // =&gt; Bruce
cardinal.color // =&gt; red
cardinal.numLegs // =&gt; 2
</pre><p></p>
<p>The constructor is more flexible. It&apos;s now possible to define the properties for each <code>Bird</code> at the time it is created, which is one way that JavaScript constructors are so useful. They group objects together based on shared characteristics and behavior and define a blueprint that automates their creation.</p>

<p>Create another <code>Dog</code> constructor. This time, set it up to take the parameters <code>name</code> and <code>color</code>, and have the property <code>numLegs</code> fixed at 4. Then create a new <code>Dog</code> saved in a variable <code>terrier</code>. Pass it two strings as arguments for the <code>name</code> and <code>color</code> properties.</p></section></div><hr></body></html>
