<p>As you have seen from applying <code>Array.prototype.map()</code>, or simply <code>map()</code> earlier, the <code>map</code> method returns an array of the same length as the one it was called on. It also doesn&apos;t alter the original array, as long as its callback function doesn&apos;t.</p>
<p>In other words, <code>map</code> is a pure function, and its output depends solely on its inputs. Plus, it takes another function as its argument.</p>
<p>It would teach us a lot about <code>map</code> to try to implement a version of it that behaves exactly like the <code>Array.prototype.map()</code> with a <code>for</code> loop or <code>Array.prototype.forEach()</code>.</p>
<p>Note: A pure function is allowed to alter local variables defined within its scope, although, it&apos;s preferable to avoid that as well.</p></section></div><hr><div><section id="instructions">
<p>Write your own <code>Array.prototype.myMap()</code>, which should behave exactly like <code>Array.prototype.map()</code>. You may use a <code>for</code> loop or the <code>forEach</code> method.</p></section></div><hr></body></html>
