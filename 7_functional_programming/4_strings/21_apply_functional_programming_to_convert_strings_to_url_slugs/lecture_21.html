<p>The last several challenges covered a number of useful array and string methods that follow functional programming principles. We&apos;ve also learned about <code>reduce</code>, which is a powerful method used to reduce problems to simpler forms. From computing averages to sorting, any array operation can be achieved by applying it. Recall that <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> are special cases of <code>reduce</code>.</p>
<p>Let&apos;s combine what we&apos;ve learned to solve a practical problem.</p>
<p>Many content management sites (CMS) have the titles of a post added to part of the URL for simple bookmarking purposes. For example, if you write a Medium post titled &quot;Stop Using Reduce&quot;, it&apos;s likely the URL would have some form of the title string in it (&quot;.../stop-using-reduce&quot;). You may have already noticed this on the freeCodeCamp site.</p></section></div><hr><div><section id="instructions">
<p>Fill in the <code>urlSlug</code> function so it converts a string <code>title</code> and returns the hyphenated version for the URL. You can use any of the methods covered in this section, and don&apos;t use <code>replace</code>. Here are the requirements:</p>
<p>The input is a string with spaces and title-cased words</p>
<p>The output is a string with the spaces between words replaced by a hyphen (<code>-</code>)</p>
<p>The output should be all lower-cased letters</p>
<p>The output should not have any spaces</p></section></div><hr></body></html>
