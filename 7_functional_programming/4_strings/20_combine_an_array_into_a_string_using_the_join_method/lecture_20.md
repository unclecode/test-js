🚀 Combine an Array into a String Using the join Method
-------------------------------------------------------

The `join` method is used to join the elements of an array together to create a string. It takes an argument for the delimiter that is used to separate the array elements in the string.

Here's an example:

var arr = \["Hello", "World"\];
var str = arr.join(" ");
// Sets str to "Hello World"

Use the `join` method (among others) inside the `sentensify` function to make a sentence from the words in the string `str`. The function should return a string. For example, "I-like-Star-Wars" would be converted to "I like Star Wars". For this challenge, do not use the `replace` method.

*   🧪 Your code should use the `join` method.
*   🧪 Your code should not use the `replace` method.
*   🧪 `sentensify("May-the-force-be-with-you")` should return a string.
*   🧪 `sentensify("May-the-force-be-with-you")` should return `"May the force be with you"`.
*   🧪 `sentensify("The.force.is.strong.with.this.one")` should return `"The force is strong with this one"`.
*   🧪 `sentensify("There,has,been,an,awakening")` should return `"There has been an awakening"`.
