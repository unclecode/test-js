<p>If you haven&apos;t already figured it out, the issue in the previous challenge was with the <code>splice</code> call in the <code>tabClose()</code> function. Unfortunately, <code>splice</code> changes the original array it is called on, so the second call to it used a modified array, and gave unexpected results.</p>
<p>This is a small example of a much larger pattern - you call a function on a variable, array, or an object, and the function changes the variable or something in the object.</p>
<p>One of the core principles of functional programming is to not change things. Changes lead to bugs. It&apos;s easier to prevent bugs knowing that your functions don&apos;t change anything, including the function arguments or any global variable.</p>
<p>The previous example didn&apos;t have any complicated operations but the <code>splice</code> method changed the original array, and resulted in a bug.</p>
<p>Recall that in functional programming, changing or altering things is called <dfn>mutation</dfn>, and the outcome is called a <dfn>side effect</dfn>. A function, ideally, should be a <dfn>pure function</dfn>, meaning that it does not cause any side effects.</p>
<p>Let&apos;s try to master this discipline and not alter any variable or object in our code.</p></section></div><hr><div><section id="instructions">
