<p>Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope.</p><p><code>INPUT -&gt; PROCESS -&gt; OUTPUT</code></p>
<p>Functional programming is about:</p>
<p>1) Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change</p>
<p>2) Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output</p>
<p>3) Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled</p></section></div><hr><div><section id="instructions">
