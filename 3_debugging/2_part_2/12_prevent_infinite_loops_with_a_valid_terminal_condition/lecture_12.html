        <div id="dynamic">

<p>The final topic is the dreaded infinite loop. Loops are great tools when you need your program to run a code block a certain number of times or until a condition is met, but they need a terminal condition that ends the looping. Infinite loops are likely to freeze or crash the browser, and cause general program execution mayhem, which no one wants.</p>
<p>There was an example of an infinite loop in the introduction to this section - it had no terminal condition to break out of the <code>while</code> loop inside <code>loopy()</code>. Do NOT call this function!</p><p></p><pre class=" language-js">function loopy() {
  while(true) {
    console.log(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
  }
}
</pre><p></p>
<p>It&apos;s the programmer&apos;s job to ensure that the terminal condition, which tells the program when to break out of the loop code, is eventually reached. One error is incrementing or decrementing a counter variable in the wrong direction from the terminal condition. Another one is accidentally resetting a counter or index variable within the loop code, instead of incrementing or decrementing it.</p>
</section></div><hr><div><section id="instructions">
<p>The <code>myFunc()</code> function contains an infinite loop because the terminal condition <code>i != 4</code> will never evaluate to <code>false</code> (and break the looping) - <code>i</code> will increment by 2 each pass, and jump right over 4 since <code>i</code> is odd to start. Fix the comparison operator in the terminal condition so the loop only runs for <code>i</code> less than or equal to 4.</p></section></div><hr></body></html>
