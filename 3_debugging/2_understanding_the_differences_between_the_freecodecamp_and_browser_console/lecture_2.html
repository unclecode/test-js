<p>You may have noticed that some freeCodeCamp JavaScript challenges include their own console. This console behaves a little differently than the browser console you used in the last challenge.</p>
<p>The following challenge is meant to highlight the main difference between the freeCodeCamp console and your browser console.</p>
<p>When you run ordinary JavaScript, the browsers console will display your <code>console.log()</code> statements the exact number of times you requested.</p>
<p>The freeCodeCamp console will print your <code>console.log()</code> statements for each test of that challenge, as well as one more time for any function calls that you have in your code.</p>
<p>This lends itself to some interesting behavior and might trip you up in the beginning, because a logged value that you expect to see only once may print out many more times.</p>
<p>If you would like to see only your single output and not have to worry about running through the test cycles, you can use <code>console.clear()</code> and check the browsers console.</p></section></div><hr><div><section id="instructions">
<p>First, use <code>console.clear()</code> to clear the browser console. After that, use <code>console.log</code> to log the <code>output</code> variable.</p></section></div><hr></body></html>
