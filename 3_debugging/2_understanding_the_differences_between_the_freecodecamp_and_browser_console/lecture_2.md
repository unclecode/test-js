ðŸš€ Understanding the Differences between the freeCodeCamp and Browser Console
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You may have noticed that some freeCodeCamp JavaScript challenges include their own console. This console behaves a little differently than the browser console you used in the last challenge.

The following challenge is meant to highlight the main difference between the freeCodeCamp console and your browser console.

When you run ordinary JavaScript, the browsers console will display your `console.log()` statements the exact number of times you requested.

The freeCodeCamp console will print your `console.log()` statements for each test of that challenge, as well as one more time for any function calls that you have in your code.

This lends itself to some interesting behavior and might trip you up in the beginning, because a logged value that you expect to see only once may print out many more times.

If you would like to see only your single output and not have to worry about running through the test cycles, you can use `console.clear()` and check the browsers console.

First, use `console.clear()` to clear the browser console. After that, use `console.log` to log the `output` variable.
