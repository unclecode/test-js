        <div id="dynamic">
            <html><head></head><body><div><section id="description">
<p>JavaScript allows the use of both single (<code>&apos;</code>) and double (<code>&quot;</code>) quotes to declare a string. Deciding which one to use generally comes down to personal preference, with some exceptions.</p>
<p>Having two choices is great when a string has contractions or another piece of text that&apos;s in quotes. Just be careful that you don&apos;t close the string too early, which causes a syntax error.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of mixing quotes:</p><p></p><pre class=" language-js">// These are correct:
const grouchoContraction = &quot;I&apos;ve had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn&apos;t it.&quot;;
const quoteInString = &quot;Groucho Marx once said &apos;Quote me as saying I was mis-quoted.&apos;&quot;;
// This is incorrect:
const uhOhGroucho = &apos;I&apos;ve had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn&apos;t it.&apos;;
</pre><p></p>
<p>Of course, it is okay to use only one style of quotes. You can escape the quotes inside the string by using the backslash (<code>\</code>) escape character:</p>
<p></p><pre class=" language-js">// Correct use of same quotes:
const allSameQuotes = &apos;I\&apos;ve had a perfectly wonderful evening, but this wasn\&apos;t it.&apos;;
</pre><p></p>

<p>Fix the string so it either uses different quotes for the <code>href</code> value, or escape the existing ones. Keep the double quote marks around the entire string.</p></section></div><hr></body></html>

            <ul>
                <li>ðŸ§ª Your code should fix the quotes around the <code>href</code> value &quot;#Home&quot; by either changing or escaping them.</li><li>ðŸ§ª Your code should keep the double quotes around the entire string.</li>
