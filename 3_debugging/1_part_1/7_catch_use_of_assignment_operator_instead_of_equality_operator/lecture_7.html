<p>Branching programs, i.e. ones that do different things if certain conditions are met, rely on <code>if</code>, <code>else if</code>, and <code>else</code> statements in JavaScript. The condition sometimes takes the form of testing whether a result is equal to a value.</p>
<p>This logic is spoken (in English, at least) as &quot;if x equals y, then ...&quot; which can literally translate into code using the <code>=</code>, or assignment operator. This leads to unexpected control flow in your program.</p>
<p>As covered in previous challenges, the assignment operator (<code>=</code>) in JavaScript assigns a value to a variable name. And the <code>==</code> and <code>===</code> operators check for equality (the triple <code>===</code> tests for strict equality, meaning both value and type are the same).</p>
<p>The code below assigns <code>x</code> to be 2, which evaluates as <code>true</code>. Almost every value on its own in JavaScript evaluates to <code>true</code>, except what are known as the &quot;falsy&quot; values: <code>false</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>&quot;&quot;</code> (an empty string), <code>NaN</code>, <code>undefined</code>, and <code>null</code>.</p><p></p><pre class=" language-js">let x = 1;
let y = 2;
if (x = y) {
  // this code block will run for any value of y (unless y were originally set as a falsy)
} else {
  // this code block is what should run (but won&apos;t) in this example
}
