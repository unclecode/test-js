<p>The below is an example of the simplest implementation of an array data structure. This is known as a <dfn>one-dimensional array</dfn>, meaning it only has one level, or that it does not have any other arrays nested within it. Notice it contains <dfn>booleans</dfn>, <dfn>strings</dfn>, and <dfn>numbers</dfn>, among other valid JavaScript data types:</p><p></p><pre class=" language-js">let simpleArray = [&apos;one&apos;, 2, &apos;three&apos;, true, false, undefined, null];
console.log(simpleArray.length);
// logs 7
</pre><p></p>
<p>All arrays have a length property, which as shown above, can be very easily accessed with the syntax <code>Array.length</code>.
A more complex implementation of an array can be seen below. This is known as a <dfn>multi-dimensional array</dfn>, or an array that contains other arrays. Notice that this array also contains JavaScript <dfn>objects</dfn>, which we will examine very closely in our next section, but for now, all you need to know is that arrays are also capable of storing complex objects.</p>
