ðŸš€ Remove Items Using splice()
------------------------------

Ok, so we've learned how to remove elements from the beginning and end of arrays using `shift()` and `pop()`, but what if we want to remove an element from somewhere in the middle? Or remove more than one element at once? Well, that's where `splice()` comes in. `splice()` allows us to do just that: **remove any number of consecutive elements** from anywhere in an array.

`splice()` can take up to 3 parameters, but for now, we'll focus on just the first 2. The first two parameters of `splice()` are integers which represent indexes, or positions, of the array that `splice()` is being called upon. And remember, arrays are _zero-indexed_, so to indicate the first element of an array, we would use `0`. `splice()`'s first parameter represents the index on the array from which to begin removing elements, while the second parameter indicates the number of elements to delete. For example:

let array = \['today', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'great'\];

array.splice(2, 2);
// remove 2 elements beginning with the 3rd element
// array now equals \['today', 'was', 'great'\]

`splice()` not only modifies the array it's being called on, but it also returns a new array containing the value of the removed elements:

let array = \['I', 'am', 'feeling', 'really', 'happy'\];

let newArray = array.splice(3, 2);
// newArray equals \['really', 'happy'\]

We've initialized an array `arr`. Use `splice()` to remove elements from `arr`, so that it only contains elements that sum to the value of `10`.

*   ðŸ§ª You should not change the original line of `const arr = [2, 4, 5, 1, 7, 5, 2, 1];`.
*   ðŸ§ª `arr` should only contain elements that sum to `10`.
*   ðŸ§ª Your code should utilize the `splice()` method on `arr`.
*   ðŸ§ª The splice should only remove elements from `arr` and not add any additional elements to `arr`.
