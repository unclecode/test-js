🚀 Nest one Array within Another Array
--------------------------------------

You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like this: `[["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]]`. This is also called a multi-dimensional array.

* * *

Create a nested array called `myArray`.

* * *

*   🧪 `myArray` should have at least one array nested within another array.
