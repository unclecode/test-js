🚀 Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays
----------------------------------------------------------------

With JavaScript `array` variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

`var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"]`.

* * *

Modify the new array `myArray` so that it contains both a `string` and a `number` (in that order).

**Hint**  
Refer to the example code in the text editor if you get stuck.

* * *

*   🧪 `myArray` should be an `array`.
*   🧪 The first item in `myArray` should be a `string`.
*   🧪 The second item in `myArray` should be a `number`.
