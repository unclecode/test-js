🚀 Comparisons with the Logical Or Operator
-------------------------------------------

The logical or operator (`||`) returns `true` if either of the operands is `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

The logical or operator is composed of two pipe symbols: (`||`). This can typically be found between your Backspace and Enter keys.

The pattern below should look familiar from prior waypoints:

if (num > 10) {
  return "No";
}
if (num < 5) {
  return "No";
}
return "Yes";

will return "Yes" only if `num` is between `5` and `10` (5 and 10 included). The same logic can be written as:

if (num > 10 || num < 5) {
  return "No";
}
return "Yes";

* * *

Combine the two `if` statements into one statement which returns `"Outside"` if `val` is not between `10` and `20`, inclusive. Otherwise, return `"Inside"`.

*   🧪 You should use the `||` operator once
*   🧪 You should only have one `if` statement
*   🧪 `testLogicalOr(0)` should return "Outside"
*   🧪 `testLogicalOr(9)` should return "Outside"
*   🧪 `testLogicalOr(10)` should return "Inside"
*   🧪 `testLogicalOr(15)` should return "Inside"
*   🧪 `testLogicalOr(19)` should return "Inside"
*   🧪 `testLogicalOr(20)` should return "Inside"
*   🧪 `testLogicalOr(21)` should return "Outside"
*   🧪 `testLogicalOr(25)` should return "Outside"
