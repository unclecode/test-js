🚀 Comparison with the Strict Equality Operator
-----------------------------------------------

Strict equality (`===`) is the counterpart to the equality operator (`==`). However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type, the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.

If the values being compared have different types, they are considered unequal, and the strict equality operator will return false.

**Examples**

3 ===  3   // true
3 === '3'  // false

In the second example, `3` is a `Number` type and `'3'` is a `String` type.

* * *

Use the strict equality operator in the `if` statement so the function will return "Equal" when `val` is strictly equal to `7`

*   🧪 `testStrict(10)` should return "Not Equal"
*   🧪 `testStrict(7)` should return "Equal"
*   🧪 `testStrict("7")` should return "Not Equal"
*   🧪 You should use the `===` operator
