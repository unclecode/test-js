🚀 Adding a Default Option in Switch Statements
-----------------------------------------------

In a `switch` statement you may not be able to specify all possible values as `case` statements. Instead, you can add the `default` statement which will be executed if no matching `case` statements are found. Think of it like the final `else` statement in an `if/else` chain.

A `default` statement should be the last case.

switch (num) {
  case value1:
    statement1;
    break;
  case value2:
    statement2;
    break;
...
  default:
    defaultStatement;
    break;
}

* * *

Write a switch statement to set `answer` for the following conditions:  
`"a"` - "apple"  
`"b"` - "bird"  
`"c"` - "cat"  
`default` - "stuff"

* * *

*   🧪 `switchOfStuff("a")` should have a value of "apple"
*   🧪 `switchOfStuff("b")` should have a value of "bird"
*   🧪 `switchOfStuff("c")` should have a value of "cat"
*   🧪 `switchOfStuff("d")` should have a value of "stuff"
*   🧪 `switchOfStuff(4)` should have a value of "stuff"
*   🧪 You should not use any `if` or `else` statements
*   🧪 You should use a `default` statement
*   🧪 You should have at least 3 `break` statements
