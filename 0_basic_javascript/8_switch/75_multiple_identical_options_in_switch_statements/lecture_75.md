🚀 Multiple Identical Options in Switch Statements
--------------------------------------------------

If the `break` statement is omitted from a `switch` statement's `case`, the following `case` statement(s) are executed until a `break` is encountered. If you have multiple inputs with the same output, you can represent them in a `switch` statement like this:

switch(val) {
  case 1:
  case 2:
  case 3:
    result = "1, 2, or 3";
    break;
  case 4:
    result = "4 alone";
}

Cases for 1, 2, and 3 will all produce the same result.

Write a switch statement to set `answer` for the following ranges:  
`1-3` - "Low"  
`4-6` - "Mid"  
`7-9` - "High"

**Note**  
You will need to have a `case` statement for each number in the range.

*   🧪 `sequentialSizes(1)` should return "Low"
*   🧪 `sequentialSizes(2)` should return "Low"
*   🧪 `sequentialSizes(3)` should return "Low"
*   🧪 `sequentialSizes(4)` should return "Mid"
*   🧪 `sequentialSizes(5)` should return "Mid"
*   🧪 `sequentialSizes(6)` should return "Mid"
*   🧪 `sequentialSizes(7)` should return "High"
*   🧪 `sequentialSizes(8)` should return "High"
*   🧪 `sequentialSizes(9)` should return "High"
*   🧪 You should not use any `if` or `else` statements
*   🧪 You should have nine `case` statements
