🚀 Selecting from Many Options with Switch Statements
-----------------------------------------------------

If you have many options to choose from, use a switch statement. A `switch` statement tests a value and can have many case statements which define various possible values. Statements are executed from the first matched `case` value until a `break` is encountered.

Here is an example of a `switch` statement:

switch(lowercaseLetter) {
  case "a":
    console.log("A");
    break;
  case "b":
    console.log("B");
    break;
}

`case` values are tested with strict equality (`===`). The `break` tells JavaScript to stop executing statements. If the `break` is omitted, the next statement will be executed.

* * *

Write a switch statement which tests `val` and sets `answer` for the following conditions:  
`1` - "alpha"  
`2` - "beta"  
`3` - "gamma"  
`4` - "delta"

* * *

*   🧪 `caseInSwitch(1)` should have a value of "alpha"
*   🧪 `caseInSwitch(2)` should have a value of "beta"
*   🧪 `caseInSwitch(3)` should have a value of "gamma"
*   🧪 `caseInSwitch(4)` should have a value of "delta"
*   🧪 You should not use any `if` or `else` statements
*   🧪 You should have at least 3 `break` statements
