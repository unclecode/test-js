🚀 Golf Code
------------

In the game of [golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf) each hole has a `par` meaning the average number of `strokes` a golfer is expected to make in order to sink the ball in a hole to complete the play. Depending on how far above or below `par` your `strokes` are, there is a different nickname.

Your function will be passed `par` and `strokes` arguments. Return the correct string according to this table which lists the strokes in order of priority; top (highest) to bottom (lowest):

Strokes

Return

1

"Hole-in-one!"

<= par - 2

"Eagle"

par - 1

"Birdie"

par

"Par"

par + 1

"Bogey"

par + 2

"Double Bogey"

\>= par + 3

"Go Home!"

`par` and `strokes` will always be numeric and positive. We have added an array of all the names for your convenience.
