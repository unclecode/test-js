ğŸš€ Introducing Else If Statements
---------------------------------

If you have multiple conditions that need to be addressed, you can chain `if` statements together with `else if` statements.

if (num > 15) {
  return "Bigger than 15";
} else if (num < 5) {
  return "Smaller than 5";
} else {
  return "Between 5 and 15";
}

Convert the logic to use `else if` statements.

* * *

*   ğŸ§ª You should have at least two `else` statements
*   ğŸ§ª You should have at least two `if` statements
*   ğŸ§ª You should have closing and opening curly braces for each `if else` code block.
*   ğŸ§ª `testElseIf(0)` should return "Smaller than 5"
*   ğŸ§ª `testElseIf(5)` should return "Between 5 and 10"
*   ğŸ§ª `testElseIf(7)` should return "Between 5 and 10"
*   ğŸ§ª `testElseIf(10)` should return "Between 5 and 10"
*   ğŸ§ª `testElseIf(12)` should return "Greater than 10"
