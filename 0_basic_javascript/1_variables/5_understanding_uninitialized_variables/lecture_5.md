🚀 Understanding Uninitialized Variables
----------------------------------------

When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of `undefined`. If you do a mathematical operation on an `undefined` variable your result will be `NaN` which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an `undefined` variable, you will get a literal string of `"undefined"`.

* * *

Initialize the three variables `a`, `b`, and `c` with `5`, `10`, and `"I am a"` respectively so that they will not be `undefined`.

* * *

*   🧪 `a` should be defined and evaluated to have the value of `6`.
*   🧪 `b` should be defined and evaluated to have the value of `15`.
*   🧪 `c` should not contain `undefined` and should have a value of "I am a String!"
*   🧪 You should not change code below the specified comment.
