🚀 Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables
----------------------------------------------

In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.

`MYVAR` is not the same as `MyVar` nor `myvar`. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing. It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity, you _do not_ use this language feature.

#### Best Practice

Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.

**Examples:**

var someVariable;
var anotherVariableName;
var thisVariableNameIsSoLong;

* * *

Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use camelCase.  
Do not create any new variables.

*   🧪 `studlyCapVar` should be defined and have a value of `10`.
*   🧪 `properCamelCase` should be defined and have a value of `"A String"`.
*   🧪 `titleCaseOver` should be defined and have a value of `9000`.
*   🧪 `studlyCapVar` should use camelCase in both declaration and assignment sections.
*   🧪 `properCamelCase` should use camelCase in both declaration and assignment sections.
*   🧪 `titleCaseOver` should use camelCase in both declaration and assignment sections.
