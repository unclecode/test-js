<p>Comments are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what that code does.</p>
<p>There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:</p>
<p>Using <code>//</code> will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line:</p><p></p><pre class=" language-js">// This is an in-line comment.
</pre><p></p>
<p>You can make a multi-line comment beginning with <code>/*</code> and ending with <code>*/</code>:</p>
<p></p><pre class=" language-js">/* This is a
multi-line comment */
</pre><p></p>
<p><strong>Best Practice</strong><br>As you write code, you should regularly add comments to clarify the function of parts of your code. Good commenting can help communicate the intent of your code&#x2014;both for others <em>and</em> for your future self.</p>
