🚀 Storing Values with the Assignment Operator
----------------------------------------------

In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator.

`myVariable = 5;`

This assigns the `Number` value `5` to `myVariable`.

Assignment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the `=` operator is resolved before the value is assigned to the variable to the left of the operator.

myVar = 5;
myNum = myVar;

This assigns `5` to `myVar` and then resolves `myVar` to `5` again and assigns it to `myNum`.

Assign the value `7` to variable `a`.

Assign the contents of `a` to variable `b`.

*   🧪 `a` should have a value of 7.
*   🧪 `b` should have a value of 7.
*   🧪 `a` should be assigned to `b` with `=`.
