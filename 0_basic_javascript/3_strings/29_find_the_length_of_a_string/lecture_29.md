🚀 Find the Length of a String
------------------------------

You can find the length of a `String` value by writing `.length` after the string variable or string literal.

`"Alan Peter".length; // 10`

For example, if we created a variable `var firstName = "Charles"`, we could find out how long the string `"Charles"` is by using the `firstName.length` property.

* * *

Use the `.length` property to count the number of characters in the `lastName` variable and assign it to `lastNameLength`.

* * *

*   🧪 You should not change the variable declarations in the `// Setup` section.
*   🧪 `lastNameLength` should be equal to eight.
*   🧪 You should be getting the length of `lastName` by using `.length` like this: `lastName.length`.
