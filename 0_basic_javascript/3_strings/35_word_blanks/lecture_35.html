<p>We will now use our knowledge of strings to build a &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs" target="_blank">Mad Libs</a>&quot; style word game we&apos;re calling &quot;Word Blanks&quot;. You will create an (optionally humorous) &quot;Fill in the Blanks&quot; style sentence.</p>
<p>In a &quot;Mad Libs&quot; game, you are provided sentences with some missing words, like nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. You then fill in the missing pieces with words of your choice in a way that the completed sentence makes sense.</p>
<p>Consider this sentence - &quot;It was really <strong>____</strong>, and we <strong>____</strong> ourselves <strong>____</strong>&quot;. This sentence has three missing pieces- an adjective, a verb and an adverb, and we can add words of our choice to complete it. We can then assign the completed sentence to a variable as follows:</p><p></p><pre class=" language-js">var sentence = &quot;It was really &quot; + &quot;hot&quot; + &quot;, and we &quot; + &quot;laughed&quot; + &quot; ourselves &quot; + &quot;silly&quot; + &quot;.&quot;;
</pre><p></p>

<p>In this challenge, we provide you with a noun, a verb, an adjective and an adverb. You need to form a complete sentence using words of your choice, along with the words we provide.</p>
<p>You will need to use the string concatenation operator <code>+</code> to build a new string, using the provided variables: <code>myNoun</code>, <code>myAdjective</code>, <code>myVerb</code>, and <code>myAdverb</code>. You will then assign the formed string to the <code>wordBlanks</code> variable.  You should not change the words assigned to the variables.</p>
<p>You will also need to account for spaces in your string, so that the final sentence has spaces between all the words. The result should be a complete sentence.</p></section></div><hr></body></html>
