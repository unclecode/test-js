ðŸš€ Constructing Strings with Variables
--------------------------------------

Sometimes you will need to build a string, [Mad Libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs) style. By using the concatenation operator (`+`), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

* * *

Set `myName` to a string equal to your name and build `myStr` with `myName` between the strings `"My name is "` and `" and I am well!"`

* * *

*   ðŸ§ª `myName` should be set to a string at least 3 characters long.
*   ðŸ§ª You should use two `+` operators to build `myStr` with `myName` inside it.
