🚀 Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript
-----------------------------------------------

We can also divide one number by another.

JavaScript uses the `/` symbol for division.

**Example**

myVar = 16 / 2; // assigned 8

* * *

Change the `0` so that the `quotient` is equal to `2`.

* * *

*   🧪 The variable `quotient` should be equal to 2.
*   🧪 You should use the `/` operator.
