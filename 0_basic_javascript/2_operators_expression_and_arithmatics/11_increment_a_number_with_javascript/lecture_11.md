ðŸš€ Increment a Number with JavaScript
-------------------------------------

You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the `++` operator.

`i++;`

is the equivalent of

`i = i + 1;`

**Note**  
The entire line becomes `i++;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

Change the code to use the `++` operator on `myVar`.
