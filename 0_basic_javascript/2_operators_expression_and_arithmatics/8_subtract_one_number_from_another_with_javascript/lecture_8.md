🚀 Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript
---------------------------------------------------

We can also subtract one number from another.

JavaScript uses the `-` symbol for subtraction.

**Example**

myVar = 12 - 6; // assigned 6

* * *

Change the `0` so the difference is `12`.

* * *

*   🧪 The variable `difference` should be equal to 12.
*   🧪 You should only subtract one number from 45.
