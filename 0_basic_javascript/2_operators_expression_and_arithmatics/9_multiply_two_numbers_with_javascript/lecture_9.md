ðŸš€ Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript
---------------------------------------

We can also multiply one number by another.

JavaScript uses the `*` symbol for multiplication of two numbers.

**Example**

myVar = 13 \* 13; // assigned 169

* * *

Change the `0` so that product will equal `80`.

* * *

*   ðŸ§ª The variable `product` should be equal to 80.
*   ðŸ§ª You should use the `*` operator.
