🚀 Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition
----------------------------------------------

In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:

`myVar = myVar + 5;`

to add `5` to `myVar`. Since this is such a common pattern, there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.

One such operator is the `+=` operator.

var myVar = 1;
myVar += 5;
console.log(myVar); // Returns 6

* * *

Convert the assignments for `a`, `b`, and `c` to use the `+=` operator.

* * *

*   🧪 `a` should equal `15`.
*   🧪 `b` should equal `26`.
*   🧪 `c` should equal `19`.
*   🧪 You should use the `+=` operator for each variable.
*   🧪 You should not modify the code above the specified comment.
