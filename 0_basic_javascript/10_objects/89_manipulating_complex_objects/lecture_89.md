🚀 Manipulating Complex Objects
-------------------------------

Sometimes you may want to store data in a flexible Data Structure. A JavaScript object is one way to handle flexible data. They allow for arbitrary combinations of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, functions, and objects.

Here's an example of a complex data structure:

var ourMusic = \[
  {
    "artist": "Daft Punk",
    "title": "Homework",
    "release\_year": 1997,
    "formats": \[ 
      "CD", 
      "Cassette", 
      "LP"
    \],
    "gold": true
  }
\];

This is an array which contains one object inside. The object has various pieces of metadata about an album. It also has a nested `"formats"` array. If you want to add more album records, you can do this by adding records to the top level array. Objects hold data in a property, which has a key-value format. In the example above, `"artist": "Daft Punk"` is a property that has a key of `"artist"` and a value of `"Daft Punk"`. [JavaScript Object Notation](http://www.json.org/) or `JSON` is a related data interchange format used to store data.

    {
      "artist": "Daft Punk",
      "title": "Homework",
      "release_year": 1997,
      "formats": [ 
        "CD",
        "Cassette",
        "LP"
      ],
      "gold": true
    }
    

**Note**  
You will need to place a comma after every object in the array, unless it is the last object in the array.

Add a new album to the `myMusic` array. Add `artist` and `title` strings, `release_year` number, and a `formats` array of strings.

* * *

*   🧪 `myMusic` should be an array
*   🧪 `myMusic` should have at least two elements
*   🧪 `myMusic[1]` should be an object
*   🧪 `myMusic[1]` should have at least 4 properties
*   🧪 `myMusic[1]` should contain an `artist` property which is a string
*   🧪 `myMusic[1]` should contain a `title` property which is a string
*   🧪 `myMusic[1]` should contain a `release_year` property which is a number
*   🧪 `myMusic[1]` should contain a `formats` property which is an array
*   🧪 `formats` should be an array of strings with at least two elements
