ðŸš€ Record Collection
--------------------

You are given a JSON object representing a part of your musical album collection. Each album has several properties and a unique id number as its key. Not all albums have complete information.

Write a function which takes an album's `id` (like `2548`), a property `prop` (like `"artist"` or `"tracks"`), and a `value` (like `"Addicted to Love"`) to modify the data in this collection.

If `prop` isn't `"tracks"` and `value` isn't empty (`""`), update or set the `value` for that record album's property.

Your function must always return the entire collection object.

There are several rules for handling incomplete data:

If `prop` is `"tracks"` but the album doesn't have a `"tracks"` property, create an empty array before adding the new value to the album's corresponding property.

If `prop` is `"tracks"` and `value` isn't empty (`""`), push the `value` onto the end of the album's existing `tracks` array.

If `value` is empty (`""`), delete the given `prop` property from the album.

**Hints**  
Use `bracket notation` when [accessing object properties with variables](learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/accessing-object-properties-with-variables).

Push is an array method you can read about on [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push).

You may refer back to [Manipulating Complex Objects](learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/manipulating-complex-objects) Introducing JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) for a refresher.

*   ðŸ§ª You should not change the `collection` object's initialization
*   ðŸ§ª After `updateRecords(5439, "artist", "ABBA")`, `artist` should be `"ABBA"`
*   ðŸ§ª After `updateRecords(5439, "tracks", "Take a Chance on Me")`, `tracks` should have `"Take a Chance on Me"` as the last element.
*   ðŸ§ª After `updateRecords(2548, "artist", "")`, `artist` should not be set
*   ðŸ§ª After `updateRecords(1245, "tracks", "Addicted to Love")`, `tracks` should have `"Addicted to Love"` as the last element.
*   ðŸ§ª After `updateRecords(2468, "tracks", "Free")`, `tracks` should have `"1999"` as the first element.
*   ðŸ§ª After `updateRecords(2548, "tracks", "")`, `tracks` should not be set
*   ðŸ§ª After `updateRecords(1245, "album", "Riptide")`, `album` should be `"Riptide"`
