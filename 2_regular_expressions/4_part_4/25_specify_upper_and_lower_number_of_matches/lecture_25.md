🚀 Specify Upper and Lower Number of Matches
--------------------------------------------

Recall that you use the plus sign `+` to look for one or more characters and the asterisk `*` to look for zero or more characters. These are convenient but sometimes you want to match a certain range of patterns.

You can specify the lower and upper number of patterns with quantity specifiers. Quantity specifiers are used with curly brackets (`{` and `}`). You put two numbers between the curly brackets - for the lower and upper number of patterns.

For example, to match only the letter `a` appearing between `3` and `5` times in the string `"ah"`, your regex would be `/a{3,5}h/`.

let A4 = "aaaah";
let A2 = "aah";
let multipleA = /a{3,5}h/;
multipleA.test(A4); // Returns true
multipleA.test(A2); // Returns false

Change the regex `ohRegex` to match the entire phrase `"Oh no"` only when it has `3` to `6` letter `h`'s.

*   🧪 Your regex should use curly brackets.
*   🧪 Your regex should not match `"Ohh no"`
*   🧪 Your regex should match `"Ohhh no"`
*   🧪 Your regex should match `"Ohhhh no"`
*   🧪 Your regex should match `"Ohhhhh no"`
*   🧪 Your regex should match `"Ohhhhhh no"`
*   🧪 Your regex should not match `"Ohhhhhhh no"`
