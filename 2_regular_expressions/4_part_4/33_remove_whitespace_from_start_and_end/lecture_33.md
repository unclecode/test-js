ðŸš€ Remove Whitespace from Start and End
---------------------------------------

Sometimes whitespace characters around strings are not wanted but are there. Typical processing of strings is to remove the whitespace at the start and end of it.

* * *

Write a regex and use the appropriate string methods to remove whitespace at the beginning and end of strings.

**Note**  
The `.trim()` method would work here, but you'll need to complete this challenge using regular expressions.

* * *

*   ðŸ§ª `result` should equal to `"Hello, World!"`
*   ðŸ§ª You should not use the `.trim()` method.
*   ðŸ§ª The `result` variable should not be set equal to a string.
