<p><dfn>Lookaheads</dfn> are patterns that tell JavaScript to look-ahead in your string to check for patterns further along. This can be useful when you want to search for multiple patterns over the same string.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of lookaheads: <dfn>positive lookahead</dfn> and <dfn>negative lookahead</dfn>.</p>
<p>A positive lookahead will look to make sure the element in the search pattern is there, but won&apos;t actually match it. A positive lookahead is used as <code>(?=...)</code> where the <code>...</code> is the required part that is not matched.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a negative lookahead will look to make sure the element in the search pattern is not there. A negative lookahead is used as <code>(?!...)</code> where the <code>...</code> is the pattern that you do not want to be there. The rest of the pattern is returned if the negative lookahead part is not present.</p>
<p>Lookaheads are a bit confusing but some examples will help.</p><p></p><pre class=" language-js">let quit = &quot;qu&quot;;
let noquit = &quot;qt&quot;;
let quRegex= /q(?=u)/;
let qRegex = /q(?!u)/;
quit.match(quRegex); // Returns [&quot;q&quot;]
noquit.match(qRegex); // Returns [&quot;q&quot;]
</pre><p></p>
<p>A more practical use of lookaheads is to check two or more patterns in one string. Here is a (naively) simple password checker that looks for between 3 and 6 characters and at least one number:</p>
<p></p><pre class=" language-js">let password = &quot;abc123&quot;;
let checkPass = /(?=\w{3,6})(?=\D*\d)/;
checkPass.test(password); // Returns true
</pre><p></p>

<p>Use lookaheads in the <code>pwRegex</code> to match passwords that are greater than 5 characters long, do not begin with numbers, and have two consecutive digits.</p></section></div><hr></body></html>
