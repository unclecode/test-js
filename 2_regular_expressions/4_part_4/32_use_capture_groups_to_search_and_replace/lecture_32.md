🚀 Use Capture Groups to Search and Replace
-------------------------------------------

Searching is useful. However, you can make searching even more powerful when it also changes (or replaces) the text you match.

You can search and replace text in a string using `.replace()` on a string. The inputs for `.replace()` is first the regex pattern you want to search for. The second parameter is the string to replace the match or a function to do something.

let wrongText = "The sky is silver.";
let silverRegex = /silver/;
wrongText.replace(silverRegex, "blue");
// Returns "The sky is blue."

You can also access capture groups in the replacement string with dollar signs (`$`).

"Code Camp".replace(/(\\w+)\\s(\\w+)/, '$2 $1');
// Returns "Camp Code"

Write a regex so that it will search for the string `"good"`. Then update the `replaceText` variable to replace `"good"` with `"okey-dokey"`.

*   🧪 You should use `.replace()` to search and replace.
*   🧪 Your regex should change `"This sandwich is good."` to `"This sandwich is okey-dokey."`
*   🧪 You should not change the last line.
