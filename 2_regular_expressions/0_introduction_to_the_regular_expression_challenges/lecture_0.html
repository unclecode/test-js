            <h2>Introduction to the Regular Expression Challenges</h2>
<p>Regular expressions are special strings that represent a search pattern. Also known as &quot;regex&quot; or &quot;regexp&quot;, they help programmers match, search, and replace text. Regular expressions can appear cryptic because a few characters have special meaning. The goal is to combine the symbols and text into a pattern that matches what you want, but only what you want. This section will cover the characters, a few shortcuts, and the common uses for writing regular expressions.</p>
