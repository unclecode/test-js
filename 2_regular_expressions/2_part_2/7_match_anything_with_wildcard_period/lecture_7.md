🚀 Match Anything with Wildcard Period
--------------------------------------

Sometimes you won't (or don't need to) know the exact characters in your patterns. Thinking of all words that match, say, a misspelling would take a long time. Luckily, you can save time using the wildcard character: `.`

The wildcard character `.` will match any one character. The wildcard is also called `dot` and `period`. You can use the wildcard character just like any other character in the regex. For example, if you wanted to match `"hug"`, `"huh"`, `"hut"`, and `"hum"`, you can use the regex `/hu./` to match all four words.

let humStr = "I'll hum a song";
let hugStr = "Bear hug";
let huRegex = /hu./;
huRegex.test(humStr); // Returns true
huRegex.test(hugStr); // Returns true

Complete the regex `unRegex` so that it matches the strings `"run"`, `"sun"`, `"fun"`, `"pun"`, `"nun"`, and `"bun"`. Your regex should use the wildcard character.

*   🧪 You should use the `.test()` method.
*   🧪 You should use the wildcard character in your regex `unRegex`
*   🧪 Your regex `unRegex` should match `"run"` in `"Let us go on a run."`
*   🧪 Your regex `unRegex` should match `"sun"` in `"The sun is out today."`
*   🧪 Your regex `unRegex` should match `"fun"` in `"Coding is a lot of fun."`
*   🧪 Your regex `unRegex` should match `"pun"` in `"Seven days without a pun makes one weak."`
*   🧪 Your regex `unRegex` should match `"nun"` in `"One takes a vow to be a nun."`
*   🧪 Your regex `unRegex` should match `"bun"` in `"She got fired from the hot dog stand for putting her hair in a bun."`
*   🧪 Your regex `unRegex` should not match `"There is a bug in my code."`
*   🧪 Your regex `unRegex` should not match `"Catch me if you can."`
