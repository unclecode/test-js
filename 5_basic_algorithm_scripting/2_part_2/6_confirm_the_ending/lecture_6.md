🚀 Confirm the Ending
---------------------

Check if a string (first argument, `str`) ends with the given target string (second argument, `target`).

This challenge _can_ be solved with the `.endsWith()` method, which was introduced in ES2015. But for the purpose of this challenge, we would like you to use one of the JavaScript substring methods instead.

Remember to use [Read-Search-Ask](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/how-to-get-help-when-you-are-stuck-coding/19514) if you get stuck. Write your own code.

*   🧪 `confirmEnding("Bastian", "n")` should return true.
*   🧪 `confirmEnding("Congratulation", "on")` should return true.
*   🧪 `confirmEnding("Connor", "n")` should return false.
*   🧪 `confirmEnding("Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen", "specification")` should return false.
*   🧪 `confirmEnding("He has to give me a new name", "name")` should return true.
*   🧪 `confirmEnding("Open sesame", "same")` should return true.
*   🧪 `confirmEnding("Open sesame", "pen")` should return false.
*   🧪 `confirmEnding("Open sesame", "game")` should return false.
*   🧪 `confirmEnding("If you want to save our world, you must hurry. We dont know how much longer we can withstand the nothing", "mountain")` should return false.
*   🧪 `confirmEnding("Abstraction", "action")` should return true.
*   🧪 Your code should not use the built-in method `.endsWith()` to solve the challenge.
