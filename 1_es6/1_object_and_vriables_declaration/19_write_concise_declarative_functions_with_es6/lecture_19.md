🚀 Write Concise Declarative Functions with ES6
-----------------------------------------------

When defining functions within objects in ES5, we have to use the keyword `function` as follows:

const person = {
  name: "Taylor",
  sayHello: function() {
    return \`Hello! My name is ${this.name}.\`;
  }
};

With ES6, You can remove the `function` keyword and colon altogether when defining functions in objects. Here's an example of this syntax:

const person = {
  name: "Taylor",
  sayHello() {
    return \`Hello! My name is ${this.name}.\`;
  }
};

Refactor the function `setGear` inside the object `bicycle` to use the shorthand syntax described above.

* * *

*   🧪 Traditional function expression should not be used.
*   🧪 `setGear` should be a declarative function.
*   🧪 `bicycle.setGear(48)` should change the `gear` value to 48.
