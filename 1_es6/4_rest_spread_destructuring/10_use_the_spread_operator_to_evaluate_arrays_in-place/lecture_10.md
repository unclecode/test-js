ðŸš€ Use the Spread Operator to Evaluate Arrays In-Place
------------------------------------------------------

ES6 introduces the spread operator, which allows us to expand arrays and other expressions in places where multiple parameters or elements are expected.

The ES5 code below uses `apply()` to compute the maximum value in an array:

var arr = \[6, 89, 3, 45\];
var maximus = Math.max.apply(null, arr); // returns 89

We had to use `Math.max.apply(null, arr)` because `Math.max(arr)` returns `NaN`. `Math.max()` expects comma-separated arguments, but not an array. The spread operator makes this syntax much better to read and maintain.

const arr = \[6, 89, 3, 45\];
const maximus = Math.max(...arr); // returns 89

`...arr` returns an unpacked array. In other words, it _spreads_ the array. However, the spread operator only works in-place, like in an argument to a function or in an array literal. The following code will not work:

const spreaded = ...arr; // will throw a syntax error

* * *

Copy all contents of `arr1` into another array `arr2` using the spread operator.

* * *

*   ðŸ§ª `arr2` should be correct copy of `arr1`.
*   ðŸ§ª `...` spread operator should be used to duplicate `arr1`.
*   ðŸ§ª `arr2` should remain unchanged when `arr1` is changed.
