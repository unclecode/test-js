ðŸš€ Use Destructuring Assignment to Extract Values from Objects
--------------------------------------------------------------

Destructuring assignment is special syntax introduced in ES6, for neatly assigning values taken directly from an object.

Consider the following ES5 code:

const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };

const name = user.name; // name = 'John Doe'
const age = user.age; // age = 34

Here's an equivalent assignment statement using the ES6 destructuring syntax:

const { name, age } = user;
// name = 'John Doe', age = 34

Here, the `name` and `age` variables will be created and assigned the values of their respective values from the `user` object. You can see how much cleaner this is.

You can extract as many or few values from the object as you want.

Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment. It should still assign the variables `today` and `tomorrow` the values of `today` and `tomorrow` from the `HIGH_TEMPERATURES` object.

*   ðŸ§ª You should remove the ES5 assignment syntax.
*   ðŸ§ª You should use destructuring to create the `today` variable.
*   ðŸ§ª You should use destructuring to create the `tomorrow` variable.
