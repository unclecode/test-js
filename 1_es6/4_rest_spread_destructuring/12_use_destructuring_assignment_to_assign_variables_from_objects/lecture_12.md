ðŸš€ Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Objects
----------------------------------------------------------------

Destructuring allows you to assign a new variable name when extracting values. You can do this by putting the new name after a colon when assigning the value.

Using the same object from the last example:

const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };

Here's how you can give new variable names in the assignment:

const { name: userName, age: userAge } = user;
// userName = 'John Doe', userAge = 34

You may read it as "get the value of `user.name` and assign it to a new variable named `userName`" and so on.

Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment. It should still assign the variables `highToday` and `highTomorrow` the values of `today` and `tomorrow` from the `HIGH_TEMPERATURES` object.

*   ðŸ§ª You should remove the ES5 assignment syntax.
*   ðŸ§ª You should use destructuring to create the `highToday` variable.
*   ðŸ§ª You should use destructuring to create the `highTomorrow` variable.
