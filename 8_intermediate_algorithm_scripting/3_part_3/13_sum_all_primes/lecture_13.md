ðŸš€ Sum All Primes
-----------------

A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 with exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. For example, 2 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 2. In contrast, 4 is not prime since it is divisible by 1, 2 and 4.

Rewrite `sumPrimes` so it returns the sum of all prime numbers that are less than or equal to num.
