            <h2>Introduction to the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challenges</h2>
<p>The following challenges are part of FCC&apos;s Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challenges. These should prepare you to complete the final challenges for the JavaScript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification.</p>
<p>These challenges will allow you to test how much you have learned and which parts you may need to review again before starting the projects.</p>
<p>With that being said-</p>
<p>Have fun and remember to use the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/how-to-get-help-when-you-are-stuck-coding/19514">Read-Search-Ask</a> method if you get stuck.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>
